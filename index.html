    <h2>Step 1: Business Areas capture the process requests</h2>
    <p>• Business areas will capture their process requests on the content management application.<br>
    • The requests come to our process backlog for prioritization.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Backlog grooming session prep</h2>
    <p>• Determine team capacity and utilization for upcoming sprint.<br>
    • Backlog grooming session is booked, and all interested stakeholders are socialized.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Internal prioritization by interested stakeholders</h2>
    <p>Interested stakeholders will earmark their priority processes ahead of the backlog session.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Facilitation of Backlog grooming session</h2>
    <p>* Updates are given regarding previous sprint (performance outcomes, learnings and continuous improvement opportunities)<br>
    * Priority of process is determined by the ABC stakeholders using the RISE framework to determine the process intake for the upcoming sprint.<br>
    * Processes to be mapped are agreed upon with ABC stakeholders for the upcoming sprint</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Sprint commences</h2>
    <p>Analysts will complete processes using the following RAG statuses:<br>
    * Client engagement<br>
    * Process walkthrough<br>
    * Process mapping<br>
    * Work instructions<br>
    * Business signoff<br>
    N.B., Business sign off is the target of the sprint as Quality Assurance & Repository Capture are external to the BizX team.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Sprint concludes</h2>
    <p>* Analysts submits processes to QA.<br>
    * Once QA is completed with checks (possible reworks) the process is then submitted to the Repository Capture team (if applicable) to capture on the Repository Capture platform.<br>
    * Once Repository Capture is completed, the process is published<br>
    * The QA and Repository Capture elements are variable regarding timelines due to the respective capabilities being external</p>
